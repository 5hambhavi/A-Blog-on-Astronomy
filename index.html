            <br>
            <h3><b>What are exoplanets?</b></h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Exoplanets or <i>extrasolar</i> planets are planets that orbit a star other than our sun or can also be
                defined as planets that are
                not a part of our solar system.
                The Greek term <i>'exo'</i> stands for <i>'outside'</i>. As these worlds are far, far away from our
                solar
                system, it is next to impossible to spot them directly with telescopes. They are so far away from all of
                humanity that the unit to measure the farness is <i>ly</i> (light years). Astronomers have confirmed
                more
                than
                4,000
                exoplanets exist and are orbiting distant stars, with at least 1,000 more awaiting confirmation. They
                found the first two exoplanets orbiting a pulsar in 1992. They confirmed the first exoplanet orbiting a
                sunlike star in
                1995.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>How do you detect exoplanets?</b></h3>
            <hr>
            <p>There are various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets">methods of
                    detecting
                    exoplanets</a>. Two major ones are :
                <br>
                <div>
                    <b>
                        <i>🠒Radial velocity</i>
                        <br>
                        <i>🠒Transit photometry</i>
                    </b>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Radial Velocity</b></h4>
                <hr>
                <p>This method uses gravity to detect planets. The planet is much smaller than its star and exerts a
                    small
                    gravitational pull on the star as it orbits. When the planet is behind its star, it pulls that star
                    slightly
                    away. When its in front of it, it pulls the star slightly towards us. This makes the star wobble.
                    Astronomers look for this wobbling to find planets. To find this wobble, they use something known as
                    a
                    spectrograph. A spectrograph is like a prism. It splits the light from the star into its component
                    colours
                    making a spectrum. Some of the light gets absorbed as it passes through a star's atmosphere. This
                    produces
                    small, dark lines in the spectrum. As the star moves closer to us, the lines shift towards the blue
                    end
                    of
                    the spectrum. As it shifts away, the lines shift to the red end. Astronomers look for orbiting
                    planets
                    by
                    looking for these back and forth movements of the lines in the spectrum.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Transit photometry</b></h4>
                <hr>
                <p>This method uses the concept of shadows to find exoplanets. Around the star, if a planet's orbit is
                    just
                    right, then the planet will regularly pass in front of it's star or transit. When it does this it
                    will
                    block a part of the star's light (like a <i>solar eclipse</i>). It's a small change but is enough to
                    clue astronomers of the presence of an exoplanet around a distant star. If the brightness of the
                    star
                    changes regularly and consistantly, it could mean that a planet is constantly revolving around its
                    star,
                    blocking some part of the star's light each time.</p>

                        but have you ever wondered, what lies beyond it ? Well, let us take a journey to the end of the

                        on
                        Earth, our home. If we go a little further away from the Earth, we arrive at the Moon, the

                        only

                    Rigel also lies in the constellation of Orion, but it is a blue supergiant instead of a red one. The
                    distance to it from Earth is approximately 860 ly. It is calculated to be anywhere between 61,500 to
                    363,000 times as luminous as the Sun and 18 to 24 times as massive.

            <p>I genuinely have no idea about how big the universe is or can be. It's just impossible to even imagine.
                The Earth itself seems so big to us humans, the universe is literally a million or even more times
                bigger. Humans have only yet discovered some parts of the universe. There is 99% more of it left for us
                to explore. I always wonder; what if there lies something else beyond it? What if there is life except
                the Earth anywhere in the universe? Would we ever be able to explore all or at least some of it? Are we
                humans alone? Is there any other living organism out there except humans? Do humans also exist somewhere
                other than on Earth? What if there are multiple universes? What if there is a multiverse? What if the
                multiverse is just as small as a planet/star in a whole other universe? What if the universe is just a
                tiny spec compared to what else is out there? There are so many questions running through my mind all
                24/7 which I think I'll never possibly get an answer to. The actual size of the universe is truly
                immeasurable. The thought that someone else must be wondering out there if there is any other form of
                life that exists apart from themselves keeps me lost in deep thoughts half of the time. If the universe
                is so big that we can't even let the thought sink in for a moment, there is absolutely no chance saying
                that
                life apart from Earth doesn't exist. It's almost like taking a spoonful of water from the ocean and
                saying
                no fish exist. It seems unrealistic. I believe that living organisms other than humans do exist (or even
                creatures that look exactly like humans), because why not in such a big world can a set of atoms be
                arranged in the exact same manner as they are arranged inside you? It may sound crazy but, I mean there
                is a possibility, right? The universe is huge. So huge that even if you went on a trip to the end of it,
                you'd never reach the end even if you kept going on like that for the rest of your life. Since the
                average lifespan of a human is somewhere between 70-80 years, we would never be able to explore or get a
                look at the magnificence of the outside world no matter how fast the rocket/spaceship is because it
                takes thousands of years
                to reach there and come back here. This world is big. The Sun itself already seems humongous to us. The
                universe is much, much more than just the Sun. The fact that no humans would ever be able to explore
                even one percent of this beauty, is just very disappointing. If it costed me my life and I were given a
                chance to explore even a small part of what all of this actually is, I wouldn't think twice. It just all
                seems so fascinating and terrifying and the same moment. Huge isn't a word that can be used for the
                real, actual size of the universe. Somehow, I just want to get a glance at all of this with my own eyes.
                I completely know that it takes many years to reach an outside star/planet, that too,
                for a satellite, not humans. It's just an impossible desire. I don't know how, just somehow, I want to
                explore at least some part of it. I'm way too curious. It all just seems so mesmerizing and too much to
                take in at the same time. Seems so unreal that all this will come to an end someday, all the
                planets/exoplanets will get eaten up by their host stars and the stars and black holes will evaporate at
                some
                point and alas, the whole universe would be shrouded with permanent darkness with absolutely no form of
                light. The thought that all of this may come to an end silently, is creepy. The universe is vast. So
                vast that I doubt anyone ever born can ever explore all of it.</p>
